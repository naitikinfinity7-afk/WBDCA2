                My name is <strong>Naitik Rawat</strong>. I am a student who is interested in
                web development, programming, and technology. I enjoy learning how websites
                are built and how users interact with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. I also
                like exploring new tools and concepts that help me become a better developer.
                Building small projects helps me understand concepts in a practical way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from coding, I enjoy listening to music, playing games, and hanging out
                with my friends. I always try to maintain a balance between my studies and my
                hobbies.
            </p>
            <p>
                My aim is to become a confident developer and work on real-world projects in
                the future. This portfolio is one of my first steps towards that goal.
